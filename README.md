## Brick Breaker Game

### 1. Class: [Game](https://github.com/Beltag-Paula/Brick-Breaker-Game/blob/main/BrickBreakerGame/src/Game.java)

#### Purpose:
The `Game` class serves as the main entry point for this Brick Breaker game. It sets up the graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing and manages the game window.

#### Key Components:
- `frame`: A `JFrame` instance that represents the main game window.
- `main` method: The entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the `Game` class and initializes the game window.
- `initialize` method: Initializes the game window properties, sets up the `GamePlay` panel, and configures the JFrame settings.

#### Connection with other Classes:
- `Game` class is connected to the `GamePlay` class by creating an instance of it and adding it to the `frame`.

#### Pros:
- Separation of concerns: The `Game` class takes care of GUI setup and game initialization, keeping the code organized.
- Ease of starting the game: The `main` method provides a straightforward entry point to launch the game.

#### Cons:
- The `Game` class could be further extended to handle game over, restart, and menu functionality, which may lead to a larger class with more responsibilities.

### 2. Class: [GamePlay](https://github.com/Beltag-Paula/Brick-Breaker-Game/blob/main/BrickBreakerGame/src/GamePlay.java)

#### Purpose:
The `GamePlay` class is the core of your Brick Breaker game. It handles the game's graphics, gameplay mechanics, and interactions.

#### Key Components:
- `play`: A boolean variable representing the game state (running or paused).
- `score`: An integer variable to track the player's score.
- `totalBricks`: An integer variable representing the total number of bricks in the game.
- `timer`: A `Timer` instance to trigger game updates at regular intervals.
- `playerX`: An integer variable representing the current position of the player's paddle.
- `ballposX` and `ballposY`: Integer variables representing the current position of the ball.
- `ballXdirection` and `ballYdirection`: Integer variables representing the current direction of the ball's movement.
- `brick`: An instance of the `BrickGenerator` class to manage the bricks.

#### Connection with other Classes:
- `GamePlay` class is connected to the `BrickGenerator` class by having an instance of it to manage the bricks' state.

#### Pros:
- Separation of concerns: The `GamePlay` class handles the game mechanics separately from the GUI, making it easier to maintain and understand.
- Extensibility: The class structure allows for easy addition of new features or improvements to the game logic.

#### Cons:
- Large `paint` method: The `paint` method handles all graphical rendering, which may become complex and hard to manage for more extensive games.
- Lack of encapsulation: Some variables (e.g., `play`, `score`, etc.) are public, making them accessible from other classes directly, which may lead to potential issues in a larger project.

### 3. Class: [BrickGenerator](https://github.com/Beltag-Paula/Brick-Breaker-Game/blob/main/BrickBreakerGame/src/BrickGenerator.java)

#### Purpose:
The `BrickGenerator` class is responsible for creating and managing the bricks in the game.

#### Key Components:
- `map`: A 2D array representing the state of each brick (whether it's still present or destroyed).
- `brickWidth` and `brickHeight`: Integer variables representing the dimensions of each brick.

#### Connection with other Classes:
- The `BrickGenerator` class is not directly connected to other classes; it is used by the `GamePlay` class to manage the bricks.

#### Pros:
- Reusability: The `BrickGenerator` class encapsulates the logic related to the bricks, making it easy to reuse in other games or projects that require brick management.
- Separation of concerns: The class handles the brick layout and state management independently, promoting code organization.

#### Cons:
- Direct access to `map` array: The `map` array is public, allowing external classes to access and modify it directly, which may lead to unintended changes.
- Dependency on dimensions: The `brickWidth` and `brickHeight` variables are set in the constructor, limiting the flexibility to change brick dimensions during the game.

### Overall Connection and Game Flow:

1. The `Game` class sets up the game window and initializes the `GamePlay` panel.

2. The `GamePlay` class handles game mechanics, ball movement, collision detection, and gameplay logic.

3. The `GamePlay` class uses the `BrickGenerator` class to manage the state of bricks in the game.

4. The `GamePlay` class communicates with the `Game` class when the game is over or when the player wants to restart the game.

### Conclusion:

This Brick Breaker game is structured around the `Game`, `GamePlay`, and `BrickGenerator` classes. The `Game` class manages the GUI, the `GamePlay` class handles the game mechanics, and the `BrickGenerator` class manages the bricks' state.

Overall, this Brick Breaker game provides a good foundation for a simple game. With further improvements, such as better encapsulation, separation of concerns, and additional features, it could be expanded into a more complex and engaging game.

As with any software project, there are areas for improvement, such as reducing dependencies and enhancing the extensibility and maintainability of the code. Nonetheless, this game demonstrates a functional and enjoyable Brick Breaker experience.
